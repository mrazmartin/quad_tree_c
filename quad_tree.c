/*  
    This work is inspired by a wikipedia article "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree"
    and a youtube tutorial by Aamir Mushtaq Siddiqui. However I made some modifications
    to his code so it should be more robust and can be applied also for non-symmetrical 
    cases.

    Since I am only redicovering coding in C after a long break, the code is (and will) not
    be optimal. Feel free to pull request via  "https://github.com/mrazmartin/quad_tree_c".

    Outside of the mentioned ispiration tutorial is the code written by Martin Mr√°z.
    https://github.com/mrazmartin

    The code is should run cross-platform, it has been tested for Linux and Windows (with MinGW).
